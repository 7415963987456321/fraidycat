**Fraidycat** is a browser extension for Chrome or Firefox---or a Dat website
that can be used in the Beaker Browser---that can be used to follow folks on
a variety of platforms. But rather than showing you a tradition 'inbox' or 'feed'
view of all the incoming posts (Fraidycat fears this unbridled firehose,) you
are shown an overview of who is active and a brief summary of their activity.

Here is my own Fraidycat home page:

In this way, Fraidycat dissolves the barriers between networks---each with their
own seeming 'network effects'---and forms a personal network for you, a personal
surveillance network, if you will, of the people you want to monitor. (It's as if
the Web itself is now your network.)

There are no fancy algorithms behind Fraidycat---everything is organized by
recency. (Although, you can sort follows into tags and priority---do I want to
track this person in real-time? Is this a band that I am just interested in checking
in on once a year?) The point isn't to discern your intent from your behavior;
the point is to give you a tool, as a rather capable kind of human being.
